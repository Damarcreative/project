The Michelin Guide arrived in Malaysia in 2022 with Kuala Lumpur (KL) and Penang seeing two restaurants in each city awarded one star each. At the mid-December announcement ceremony recently, Dewakan was the first restaurant called up to the podium. This came as no surprise as its founder and head chef, Darren Teoh has long been one of the country’s most influential innovators and pioneers of modern Malaysian Cuisine.

Beyond Dewakan, Teoh and Leisa Tyler (a food and travel journalist formerly of Asia’s 50 Best as well as co-owner of Weeds n More, Cameron Highlands-based farm collective supplying ethically-grown premium European produce to top Malaysian and Singaporean restaurants and hotels) have been busy with the Kita Food Festival. This chef-led food festival debuted last year and was a welcome return to the joy of eating out and drinking for foodies with a series of chef collaborations and masterclasses spanning Penang and Kuala Lumpur with some of the country’s most talented chefs.
